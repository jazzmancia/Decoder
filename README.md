# Decoder


Bootcamp capstone project for JavaScript fundamentals

Features JavaScript simulations of three age-old analog encoding methods:

• Caesar Shift: Shifts a message up or down along the 26 characters of the alphabet, based on a given shift value. E.g., "a ball" becomes "c dcnn" with a shift value of 2 or "y zyjj" with a shift value of -2.

• Polybius Square: Assigns every character of the alphabet to x-y coordinates on a 5x5 grid, with I/J sharing coordinates. E.g. "a ball" becomes "11 21111313".

• Substitution Alphabet: A 26-character "substitution" alphabet is provided along with the message, and the characters of the original message are switched to their substitute characters. E.g. "a ball" becomes "q wqss" with a substitution alphabet of "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm".
